To run the server you will need to install Node.js and
npm (this should come with Node.js). Once these are
downloaded, you need to use npm to install Socket.io and express.

The commands for those are:
	 npm install socket.io
 	 npm install express

To run the client, type http://localhost:8080/chat.html in your browser with
the server running and the client should start up. Chrome and Firefox have been tested.
